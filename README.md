## Pokemontrainer

This program is a school project created by Mikko Siukola and Jukka Juntunen.
The program is created using Angular framework.

The idea of this simple program is to show different pokemons on the screen and then user can select the ones he/she likes
and they are stored to a new collection. User can also go and see the details of the selected pokemon and also see all the collected pokemons.

The program consists of four parts: login screen, catalogue screen, detail screen and collected pokemons screen.
The info and the images of different pokemons are get from the free pokemon api: https://pokeapi.co/.
